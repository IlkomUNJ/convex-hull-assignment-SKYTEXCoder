# AI Usage
> Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  
- **I only used an AI LLM (Specifically **ChatGPT 5**) only to get a general understanding of what it is that I need to know of and what I need to do in general (to point me in the right direction) and to help me figure out how to submit the project for submission.**

Queries I used:

![**Algorithm SLOWCONVEXHULL(P) Input. A set P of points in the plane. Output. A list L containing the vertices of CH(P) in clockwise order. 1. E ← /0. 2. for all ordered pairs (p,q) ∈ P×P with p not equal to q 3. do valid ← true 3 Chapter 1 COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY 4. for all points r ∈ P not equal to p or q 5. do if r lies to the left of the directed line from p to q 6. then valid ← false. 7. if valid then Add the directed edge → pq to E. 8. From the set E of edges construct a list L of vertices of CH(P), sorted in clockwise order. I took this off of the Computational Geometry: Third Edition book because right now i'm quite literally in a Komputer Grafik lecture with my lecturer explaining something about convex and concave hulls???? How does this algorithm work???**](image.png)

![**please explain the slow convex hull (brute force method) and the standard convex hull algorithm (in my specific case it turns out to be the andrew's monotone chain algorithm) to me. How do they work????**](image-1.png)
- 

- ![**how do i create a UI in qt creator using the qt6 framework and c++??? please explain absolutely ALL of the libraries, frameworks, the APIs, that i can use to do this**](image-2.png)

- ![**how do i link a button to a "backend function" in qt6 framework while developing using the qt creator IDE and c++???**](image-3.png)

- ![**what's the difference between dereferencing and using the ampersand operator/keyword (idk) in c++???**](image-4.png)

- ![**how do i create message box in qt???**](image-8.png)

- ![**create a codes to draw line in qt6 using qmainwindow and c++**](image-5.png)

- ![**how do i draw points on qt???? and draw like a red line or a blue line in between all of those points???**](image-6.png)

- ![**what's the difference between qpoint and qpointf???**](image-7.png)

- ![continuation of the above image](image-13.png)

- ![**how do i get git to show the list of everything that's currently being tracked???**](image-10.png)

- ![**How do I "put text on the back" in a markdown file???? I want to differentiate between the instruction that was provided by my lecturer and my answer to the instruction under the header**](image-11.png)

- ![**how do i put newlines in a markdown file???**](image-12.png)


# Collaboration Usage
> Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 
- I did not collaborate with anyone, take advantage of, or use the knowledge of other people (e.g. my friends/classmates) in order to complete this assignment. So it's primarily self-taught all by myself and lots and lots of google searches and youtube videos.

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
